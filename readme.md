This package is regarding the google foobar challenged that I faced.

## Description 🐇

The #GoogleFoobarChallenge has been known for the last 5 years or more as a secret process of hiring developers and programmers all over the world. (This one guy said that after completing Level 3 [1], he got to submit his personal details with a recruiter for a potential future interview!)

In 2014, Google created this secret web tool called foo.bar, which is triggered when a user googles certain search terms related to programming languages of Python and Java.
